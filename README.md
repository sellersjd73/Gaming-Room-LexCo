# The-Gaming-Room
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client wished to design an existing game called Draw it or Lose it to run on multiple Operating Platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I tried to keep it as short as possible while mentioning all the major points. Often large documents are daunting and I wanted something that can be used multiple times during development without it being too much.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The organization is very nice. I work for a local government and I am managing several projects myself. I am now modeling documents I use for my process after this because it covers a lot of questions I may have during development. When it comes to first-steps, this is a must.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably alter the recomendations. I feel like not knowing the budget limits the potential of what to focus on with the recomendations and, in turn, require adjustments to the document 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Just because you have an idea of what to do doesn't mean the user will like it, can afford it, or want to deal with the conditions of it. Ultimately they are the ones employing your services and they decide what to do with the product you create. If the customer is happy, then your company is happy.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I'm very methodical and I like having a step-by-step schedule set up. More often than not, I get overwhelmed by all the little things. It helps me focus if I set a schedule of focus for myself and accomplish the tasks one at a time. I will deffinetly use a UML and software design document in my future business practices.
